Introduction
============

This repository contains the skeleton and all the boilerplate code required to
create an extension package for Bika LIMS.

By itself, this product simply installs bika.lims through the dependency
specified in setup.py; there is no active working code in this package.

Usage
=====

1. Fork this repository on github.

2. Clone your new forked repository to your local machine.

3. Read and explore.

You can rename the repository and package as you see fit, though neither of
these things are relevant to the code's functioning.  In any text in this
package, the name will be assumed to be "bika.custom".

Required reading
================

- archetypes.schemaextender is used for adding/removing/re-ordering fields,
and for basically anything else related to modifying the AT schemas.  The
readme can be found here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/archetypes.schemaextender

Questions?
==========

There are a lot of moving parts, and most of them are not well documented in this package.
Join the bika-developers mailing list, or visit #bika on irc.freenode.net if something
is missing, and we can work on it and maybe document it together.
